# EncapsulationPractice

In this example, you are asked to create a Car class.

Properties of the Car class -> Brand, Model, Color, Number of Doors

Our Properties are done with the encapsulation process for the number of Doors

If a Car object is created and a value other than 2 or 4 is assigned for the Number of Doors, let's publish a warning message on the console screen and assign the Number of Doors value as -1.
